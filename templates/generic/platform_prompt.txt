# Generic Platform Guidelines

Follow these general software development best practices.

## Code Quality

### Clean Code Principles
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Keep functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Avoid deep nesting - use early returns
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY) - extract common patterns
- Follow the project's existing style and conventions

### Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully, don't ignore them
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Consider edge cases and invalid inputs

### Testing
- Write tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests focused and readable
- Run existing tests to ensure no regressions

### Documentation
- Add comments for non-obvious logic
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes

## Version Control

### Commits
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Write clear commit messages
- Don't commit broken code

### Code Review Ready
- Ensure code is readable and well-organized
- Remove debugging code and commented-out code
- Check for security vulnerabilities

## Build & Dependencies

- Keep the build passing at all times
- Don't add unnecessary dependencies
- Follow semantic versioning for version updates
