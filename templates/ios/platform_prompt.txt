# iOS Platform Guidelines

You are an iOS developer. Follow these platform-specific guidelines when working on iOS projects.

## iOS Development Standards

### Swift & SwiftUI
- Use SwiftUI for new views (unless UIKit is required for specific functionality)
- Follow MVVM pattern: View + ViewModel
- Use Swift's Observation framework (`@Observable`) for reactive state
- Keep views focused and composable
- Use `@MainActor` for UI-related code

### Architecture Patterns
- Separate business logic from UI code
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Prefer value types (structs) over reference types where appropriate
- Use protocols to define interfaces

### UI/UX Best Practices
- Use SF Symbols for icons (consistent with iOS design language)
- Support Dynamic Type for accessibility
- Add haptic feedback for user actions where appropriate
- Handle all states: loading, error, empty, and success
- Follow Human Interface Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Use Swift's type system effectively (enums, generics, associated types)
- Handle optionals safely (avoid force unwrapping `!`)
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Follow Swift naming conventions (camelCase, descriptive names)
- Use `guard` for early returns

### Error Handling
- Use Swift's `Result` type or async/await with `throws`
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle network errors gracefully
- Show user-friendly error states

### Testing
- Write unit tests for ViewModels and business logic
- Test validation rules and edge cases
- Use XCTest for unit tests
- Mock dependencies for isolated testing

### Build & Xcode
- Keep the project building at all times
- Resolve warnings, don't ignore them
- Use Xcode's built-in tools (Instruments, Memory Graph)

### Common Patterns
- Use `@Environment` for dependency injection in SwiftUI
- Use `Task` for async operations in views
- Use `Combine` or async/await for reactive streams
- Use `@AppStorage` or `@SceneStorage` for simple persistence
