# Use bash as the default shell
shell=bash

# Minimum severity level (error, warning, info, style)
severity=warning

# Excluded rules:
# SC1090 - Can't follow non-constant source (we source files dynamically)

# SC2034 - Variable appears unused (we export many variables for sourced scripts)
# SC2155 - Declare and assign separately (common pattern in our scripts)
# SC2086 - Double quote to prevent globbing (intentional word splitting in some cases)
