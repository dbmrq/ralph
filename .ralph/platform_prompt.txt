# Go Platform Guidelines

You are working on a Go project. Follow these guidelines:

## Code Style
- Follow standard Go conventions (gofmt, golint)
- Use meaningful package and variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Document exported functions and types with godoc comments

## Error Handling
- Always handle errors explicitly - never ignore them
- Use error wrapping with fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)
- Return errors up the call stack, handle at appropriate level
- Use custom error types when additional context is needed

## Project Structure
- Use internal/ for private packages
- Use cmd/ for executable entry points
- Use pkg/ only for packages intended for external use
- Keep package dependencies minimal and acyclic

## Testing
- Write table-driven tests where appropriate
- Use t.Helper() in test helper functions
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use subtests for better organization

## Concurrency
- Use context.Context for cancellation and timeouts
- Prefer channels for communication, mutexes for state
- Be explicit about goroutine lifetimes
- Use sync.WaitGroup for goroutine synchronization

## Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Vendor critical dependencies if needed
- Use go mod tidy regularly
- Pin versions for reproducibility

## Charmbracelet Libraries
This project uses Charmbracelet libraries for TUI:
- Bubble Tea: Follow the Elm architecture (Model, Update, View)
- Lip Gloss: Use consistent styling via a styles package
- Keep UI components in separate files
- Use custom messages for state updates
